My clever little program will randomly generate a number for you to guess.
If you guess too high, it will tell you so try to guess a lower number.
If you guess too low, it will tell you so try to guess a higher number.
This will repeat until you guess thecorrect number. Try to guess it in the lowest time possible in order to get the lowest highscore.
Have fun and good luck!""")
